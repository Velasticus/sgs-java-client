RedDwarf Java Client SDK Distribution
Version ${sgs-client.version}

INTRODUCTION

RedDwarf lets developers write scalable, reliable, persistent
and fault-tolerant game server applications using simple
single-threaded, event-driven code.

This distribution of the RedDwarf Java Client SDK contains everything
you need to develop and run game clients that communicate with each
other and with game servers implemented with the RedDwarf
Server.  The RedDwarf Server is available as a separate
download.

See the CHANGELOG file for a summary of recent changes, and the
API-CHANGES file for a detailed list of recent changes to the API.

CONTENTS

This distribution contains the following subdirectories:

- doc
  Documentation for the client API

- lib
  JAR files needed to develop and run client applications
	
- tutorial
  Documentation and sample code for the client tutorial

DEVELOPING AND RUNNING

classpath:

   lib/sgs-client.jar


KNOWN ISSUES

This version of the RedDwarf Java Client SDK has the following
limitations:

- This release supports only limited I/O throttling, so it is possible
  for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and cause the
  server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround, developers
  must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster than the
  server application can process it.
